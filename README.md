# TextBase

Nothing is more frustrating than spending hundreds of dollars on textbooks, just to find out that you never even cracked them open! College is getting more and more expensive, and in an effort to prevent students from wasting money on textbooks they'll never use, we created TextBase.co!

# What is Textbase?
TextBase.co is a college textbook review site intended to be as transparent as possible about the usefulness of these expensive textbooks. Students can not only gain insight about how effective certain textbooks are, they can also feel comfortable that they will be putting their money to good use when they do decide to purchase a textbook. Students can search up a textbook and see the reviews of other students. They can also leave their own reviews, and if they find a textbook that hasn't been reviewed yet, they can add that book to help future students!
